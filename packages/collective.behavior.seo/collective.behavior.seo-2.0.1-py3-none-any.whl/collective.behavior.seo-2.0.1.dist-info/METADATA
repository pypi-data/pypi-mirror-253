=======================
collective.behavior.seo
=======================

This small behavior adds extra fields used for SEO optimisation.
Inspired by collective.seo, but the data store now uses dexterity/behavior practice.


Features
--------

Adds fields SEO Title, SEO Description, and Metatag Robots on an extra tab SEO on contenttypes where the behavior is activated.

When the fields contain values, the ``<title>`` and ``<meta name='description'>`` in the ``<head>`` section will be replaced.
Also a ``<meta name="robots">`` tag will be added.

In a control panel you can give a list of valid combinations of robot tags: ``follow/nofollow``, ``index/noindex``.


Translations
------------

This product has been translated into:

- Dutch


Installation
------------

Install collective.behavior.seo by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.behavior.seo


and then running ``bin/buildout``.
Or install it with ``pip``.

Activate the add'on in the Plone Contron Panel. Then go to Dexterity Types in the Plone Control Panel
and activate this behavior on selected content types.

Changelog

  [1letter]


2.0.0 (2023-03-14)
------------------

- Fix ValueError during editing when robot tags in control panel are not unique.
  Fixes `issue 2 <https://github.com/collective/collective.behavior.seo/issues/2>`_.
  [maurits]

- Add Continuous Integration for supported Plone and Python combinations.
  Uses tox, gh-actions, and `collective/tox-action <https://github.com/collective/tox-action>`_.
  [maurits]

- Drop support for Python 2.
  Plone 5.2 and 6.0 on Python 3 are supported.

  [maurits]


1.0.2 (2023-03-14)
------------------

- Removed English locale.  I think there used to be a need for this long time ago, but not anymore, as far as I know.
  [maurits]

- Changed ``<head>`` to ``'head'`` in help text and translations.
  ``<head>`` gets swallowed:
  you got "the section of a page" and now "the 'head' section of a page".
  [maurits]

- Fixed broken html in edit form on Plone 6 due to Dutch typo.
  We used ``<head`` and this made the Save/Cancel buttons show only on the SEO fieldset.
  And this fieldset showed an extra footer.
  [maurits]
