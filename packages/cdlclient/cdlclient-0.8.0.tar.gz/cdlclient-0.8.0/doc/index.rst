DataLab Simple Client User Guide
================================

DataLab is a **generic signal and image processing software**
with unique features designed to meet industrial requirements.
It is based on Python scientific libraries (such as NumPy,
SciPy or scikit-image) and Qt graphical user interfaces (thanks to
the powerful `PlotPyStack`_ - mostly the `guidata`_ and `PlotPy`_ libraries).

For more details, see DataLab `Documentation`_.

DataLab Simple Client (``cdlclient`` package) is a Python library providing a
remote proxy to a DataLab application (server). It allows to use DataLab
features from a remote computer, and/or from a third-party application.

It also provides widgets to embed DataLab features in a Qt application
(connection dialog, etc.). For this particular use case, the library relies
on `QtPy`_.

    DataLab is powered by `PlotPyStack <https://github.com/PlotPyStack>`_,
    the scientific Python-Qt visualization and graphical user interface stack.

.. note:: DataLab was created by `Codra`_/`Pierre Raybaut`_ in 2023. It is
          developed and maintained by DataLab open-source project team with
          the support of `Codra`_.
