# aircraft_classifiers_jme45
> Package for classifiers for aircraft classification, to be used in several other projects.
> Based on FGVCA aircraft data (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.5151.pdf), though this code allows one to use a subset

This is not expected to be of sufficient general interest that other people might want to install it, but for my personal use it is useful to have it on pypi.

## Installation
pip install aircraft_classifiers_jme45
