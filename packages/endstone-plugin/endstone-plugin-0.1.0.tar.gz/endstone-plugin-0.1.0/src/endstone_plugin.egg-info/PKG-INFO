# Endstone Python Plugin Template

Welcome to the official Python plugin template for Endstone. This repository provides a basic structure and a sample
plugin to help developers start writing plugins for the Bedrock Dedicated Servers in Python using the Endstone API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher.
- Endstone installed and set up in your Python environment.

## Structure Overview

```

```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EndstoneMC/python-plugin-template.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Cloned Directory**

   ```bash
   cd python-plugin-template
   ```

3. **Configurate**
    1. Open the `pyproject.toml` and change the `name` under the `[project]` section from `endstone-plugin` to your own
       name for your plugin.
    2. Rename the folder `src/endstone_plugin` to `src/{your_plugin_name}`.
    3. Rename the `PythonSamplePlugin` class within `src/{your_plugin_name}/__init__.py` to, for example.
    4. Open the `pyproject.toml` again and update the entrypoint under the `[project.entry-points."endstone"]` section.

4. **Test Your Plugin**

   When developing the plugin, you may want to install an editable package to your Python environment, this allows you
   to update the codes without having to reinstall the package everytime:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
   **NOTE: It is strongly recommended to create a virtual environment for your Endstone server and plugins. When
   installing your plugin using `pip install`, please ensure the virtual environment is activated.**

   Ensure your plugin is loaded correctly by checking the server logs or console for the log messages.

5. **Package and Distribute Your Plugin**

   When everything is good to go, you can package your plugin into a `.whl` (Wheel) file for easier distribution:

   ```bash
   pip install wheel
   python -m pip wheel . --no-deps --wheel-dir=wheelhouse
   ```

   This command will produce a `.whl` file in the `wheelhouse` directory which can be installed. To publish your plugin
   to a package index such as PyPI, please refer to:
    - [Using TestPyPI](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-testpypi/)
    - [Publishing package distribution releases using GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/)
