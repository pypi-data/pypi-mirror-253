QueuePipeIO and LimitedQueuePipeIO
==================================

This Python package provides two classes, ``QueuePipeIO`` and
``LimitedQueuePipeIO``, that represent queue-based I/O objects. These
classes are ideal for multi-threaded or asynchronous programming where
data is produced in one thread or coroutine and consumed in another.

Installation
------------

You can install this package from PyPI:

::

   pip install queuepipeio

Usage
-----

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use ``QueuePipeIO`` and
``LimitedQueuePipeIO``:

.. code:: python

   from queuepipeio import QueuePipeIO, LimitedQueuePipeIO

   # Define MB as a constant
   MB = 1024 * 1024

   # Create a QueuePipeIO object
   qpio = QueuePipeIO(chunk_size=8*MB)

   # Write data to the queue
   qpio.write(b'Hello, world!')

   # Close the writer
   qpio.close()

   # Read data from the queue
   data = qpio.read()

   print(data)  # Outputs: b'Hello, world!'

   # Create a LimitedQueuePipeIO object with a memory limit
   lqpio = LimitedQueuePipeIO(memory_limit=16*MB, chunk_size=8*MB)

   # Write data to the queue
   lqpio.write(b'Hello, again!')

   # Close the writer
   lqpio.close()

   # Read data from the queue
   data = lqpio.read()

   print(data)  # Outputs: b'Hello, again!'
