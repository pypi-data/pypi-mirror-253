## Self-Rewarding Language Model (wip)

Implementation of the training framework proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10020">Self-Rewarding Language Model</a>, from MetaAI

They really took the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290">title of the DPO paper</a> to heart.

May generalize the framework so one can add <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01335v1">SPIN</a> as well.

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://a16z.com/supporting-the-open-source-ai-community/">A16Z Open Source AI Grant Program</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for the generous sponsorships, as well as my other sponsors, for affording me the independence to open source current artificial intelligence research
