## suko-generator

Suko (a modified Sudoku game) is a popular logic-based number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 3x3 grid with digits that compose the grid (often called regions or boxes) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

This generator is able to generate a random pattern (digits) with sums and hints.
