# Threat Speech Recognition - Research Project
This project focuses on implementing a Threat Speech Recognition system using Python and incorporating machine learning concepts. The goal is to develop a system that can identify and classify threatening or harmful speech within audio recordings.

## Installation
To get started with the Threat Speech Recognition project, clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/threat-speech-recognition.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd threat-speech-recognition
```


## Dataset
The success of the Threat Speech Recognition model depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset. We recommend using a labeled dataset containing both non-threatening and threatening speech samples. Ensure that the dataset is appropriately preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance the project. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide feedback.
