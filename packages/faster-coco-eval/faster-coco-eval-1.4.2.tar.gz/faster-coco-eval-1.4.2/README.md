# Faster-COCO-Eval

## Disclaimer

I often use this project, but I saw it abandoned and without a public repository on github.
Also, part of the project remained unfinished for a long time. I implemented some of the author's ideas and decided to make the results publicly available.

## Faster-COCO-Eval base

This package wraps a facebook C++ implementation of COCO-eval operations found in the
[pycocotools](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/tree/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools) package.
This implementation greatly speeds up the evaluation time
for coco's AP metrics, especially when dealing with a high number of instances in an image.

## Comparison

For our use case with a test dataset of 5000 images from the coco val dataset.
Testing was carried out using the mmdetection framework and the eval_metric.py script. The indicators are presented below.

Visualization of testing **comparison.ipynb** available in directory [examples/comparison](./examples/comparison/comparison.ipynb)
Tested with yolo3 model (bbox eval) and yoloact model (segm eval)

| Type | COCOeval    | COCOeval_faster | Profit      |
| ---- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| bbox | 18.477 sec. | 7.345 sec.      | 2.5x faster |
| segm | 29.819 sec. | 15.840 sec.     | 2x faster   |

## Usage

This package contains a faster implementation of the
 [pycocotools](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/tree/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools) `COCOEval` class.  
To import and use `COCOeval_faster` type:

````python  
from faster_coco_eval import COCO, COCOeval_faster
....
````

For usage, look at the original `COCOEval` [class documentation.](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi)

## Usage plot curves

````python  
from faster_coco_eval import COCO
from faster_coco_eval.extra import Curves

cocoGt = COCO(....)
cocoDt = cocoGt.loadRes(....)

cur = Curves(cocoGt, cocoDt, iou_tresh=0.5, iouType='segm')
cur.plot_pre_rec()
````

## Usage pnly GT preview

```py
cocoGt = COCO(....)
    preview = PreviewResults(cocoGt, iouType="segm")
    preview.display_tp_fp_fn(
        data_folder=.....,
        image_ids=list(cocoGt.imgs.keys())[:2],
        display_gt=True,
    )
```
