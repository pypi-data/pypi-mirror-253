# PyIPF
The `pyipf` package provides a function to perform Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), also known as
RAS or biproportional fitting. It is the operation of adjusting an initial N-dimensional matrix such that
its marginal sums match N target matrices of dimension N-1. In the 2-D case, the matrix is adjusted until
the row and column sums match two target vectors.
