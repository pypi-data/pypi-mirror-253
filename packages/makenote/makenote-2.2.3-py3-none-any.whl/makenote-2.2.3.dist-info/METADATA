# usage


## adding notes

to add note to a specified table, run this:
```bash
makenote [-t <table_name>] <note_text>
```

in which note text is the note you want to be added.

for example:
```bash
makenote I am reading page 754 of the book
```

this tool can also get input from stdin. so you can add notes like this:
```bash
echo "I installed makenote tool" | makenote --table journals
```

if you do not specify table_name, then note will be stored in default table which is `journals`.



## creating tables

this tool uses different tables for storing notes.  
for example you can classify your notes in "journals", "tasks", "work", etc.

to create a table, run this:
```bash
makenote --create <table_name>
```
in which `<table_name>` is the name of table you want to be created.

## listing tables

to get a list of tables you have created, run this:
```bash
makenote --list
```

## showing records

to see the notes you have stored in a table, run this:
```bash
makenote --show [<table_name>]
```
if you do not specify table_name, the default table will be shown.

## getting help

run:

```bash
makenote -h
```

# export all notes
database file is stored in path below:

`~/.local/share/makenote/databases/diaryFile.db`

for backing notes up, just copy the file into somewhere.

for restoring, just copy the `diaryFile.db` into the path.
