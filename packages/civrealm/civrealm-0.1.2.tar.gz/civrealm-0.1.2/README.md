CivRealm is an interactive environment for the open-source strategy game [Freeciv-web](https://github.com/freeciv/freeciv-web), based on [Freeciv](https://www.freeciv.org/), a Civilization-like game. Within CivRealm, we provide interfaces for two typical types of agents: tensor-based reinforcement learning agents (see [Tensor-agent Repo](https://gitlab.mybigai.ac.cn/civilization/freeciv-tensor-baseline)) based on the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API, and language-based agents (see [LLM-agent Repo](http://civilization.pages.mybigai.ac.cn/civrealm)) driven by language models.

We also provide a set of tools for training and evaluating agents, as well as a set of baselines for both types of agents. We hope that CivRealm can serve as a testbed for the development and evaluation of agents that can learn and reason in complex environments. Detailed usage of the CivRealm API can be found in the [Documentation](http://civilization.pages.mybigai.ac.cn/civrealm).

## About

CivRealm is developed based on [freeciv-bot](https://github.com/chris1869/freeciv-bot), dependent on [freeciv-web](<https://github.com/freeciv/freeciv-web>) and [FCIV-NET](<https://github.com/fciv-net/fciv-net>).
In the future, CivRealm will be maintained by [BIGAI](https://www.bigai.ai/).

## Prerequisites

CivRealm requires Python `â‰¥ 3.8` and docker. We have tested on Ubuntu 22.04, Mac OS X, and Windows. To test CivRealm on <http://localhost>, please follow the docker installation instructions on <https://gitlab.mybigai.ac.cn/civilization/freeciv-web.git>.

## Installation

You can install the CivRealm stable version by:

```bash
pip install civrealm
```

To install the latest version from the source code or contribute to the project, please follow the instructions below:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.mybigai.ac.cn:2222/civilization/civrealm.git && cd civrealm
pip install -e .
```

<!-- 
### Update the freeciv-web image

Start the freeciv-web docker:

```bash
cd freeciv-web
docker compose up -d
```

Activate the civrealm virtual environment, and update the freeciv-web image:

```bash
update_freeciv_web_docker
```

Restart the freeciv-web container so that the change takes effect

```bash
cd freeciv-web
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```
-->

## Testing the Installation

Before testing the installation, please make sure that the freeciv-web service is running. You can check the status of the freeciv-web service by running:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see a docker container named `freeciv-web` running.

### Single player mode (against built-in AIs)

To test the installation, run the following command after installation. This will start a single player game against the built-in AIs with the default settings.

```bash
test_civrealm
```

!!! success
    If the installation is successful, the output should be similar to the following:

    ```bash
    Reset with port: 6300
    Step: 0, Turn: 1, Reward: 0, Terminated: False, Truncated: False, action: ('unit', 104, 'move NorthEast')
    Step: 1, Turn: 1, Reward: 0, Terminated: False, Truncated: False, action: ('unit', 117, 'move North')
    Step: 2, Turn: 1, Reward: 0, Terminated: False, Truncated: False, action: ('unit', 118, 'move North')
    Step: 3, Turn: 1, Reward: 0, Terminated: False, Truncated: False, action: ('unit', 119, 'move SouthEast')
    Step: 4, Turn: 1, Reward: 0, Terminated: False, Truncated: False, action: ('unit', 120, 'move SouthEast')
    ```

### Multiplayer mode

To test with multiple players, run the following command in a terminal to start the game with player `myagent`:

```bash
test_civrealm --minp=2 --username=myagent --client_port=6001
```

Then start another terminal and join the game with player `myagent1`:

```bash
test_civrealm --username=myagent1 --client_port=6001
```

<!-- ### Using a different freeciv version

As a standard, the official docker image from the [official repository](https://github.com/freeciv/freeciv-web) will be pulled. If you want to create a custom freeciv server (e.g., different rulesets, customizations, etc.) you can use `build_freeciv_server` to create a custom docker image or run a separate image in parallel. In this case, you might need to adapt src/init_server.py -->

## Trouble Shooting

The following are some common issues that you may encounter when running the code. If you encounter any other issues, please feel free to open an issue.

- If firefox keeps loading the page, please try to add the following line to `/etc/hosts`:

    ```bash
    127.0.0.1 maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com
    127.0.0.1 cdn.webglstats.com
    ```

- If you encounter the following error when running `sudo civ_prep_selenium.sh`, please try [this solution](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/724518/the-following-packages-have-unmet-dependencies-containerd-io).

    ```bash
    ...
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
    containerd.io : Conflicts: containerd
                    Conflicts: runc
    ...
    ```

- If you see the following error when running `test_civrealm`,  please see [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72405117/selenium-geckodriver-profile-missing-your-firefox-profile-cannot-be-loaded). If this does not solve the problem, please check `geckodriver.log` for more information.

    ```bash
    selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: Process unexpectedly closed with status 1
    ```

    One potential solution on Ubuntu 22.04 is:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install firefox-geckodriver
    ln -s /snap/bin/firefox.geckodriver geckodriver
    ```

- If you see the following error when setting `take_screenshot: True`, it is caused by snap version of Firefox. Please try [System Firefox installation](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux#w_install-firefox-from-mozilla-builds-for-advanced-users).

  ```bash
  Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded. 
  It may be missing or inaccessible.
  ```

- If the screenshot is not centered on the location of your first unit, it is because you are using multiple displays. Please ensure the Firefox browser for screenshot pops up on your primary display.
