NAME

::

   LIBOBJ - object library


DESCRIPTION

::

   LIBOBJ is a python3 library providing all the tools to program with
   objects. It has a obj package with a core Object that provides a
   clean namespace (without methods) that allows for saving to/from
   disk. LIBOBJ uses this to provide an object store to store objects
   and have them query-able with iterators over collection of objects.
   Saving takes place in a time stamped, full qualified name of the
   type in the pathname, that allows for easy reconstruction of
   objects. A object broker is also there so you can cache objects
   and have them servicable on a id string.

   LIBOBJ is Public Domain.


SYNOPSIS

::

   >>> from obj import Object, read, write
   >>> o = Object()
   >>> o.a = "b"
   >>> write(o, "test")
   >>> oo = Object()
   >>> read(oo, "test")
   >>> oo
   {"a": "b"}
