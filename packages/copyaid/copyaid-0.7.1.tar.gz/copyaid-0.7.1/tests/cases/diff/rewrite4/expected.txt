Bibliographic references should clearly identify research documents.
When referencing a baseprint,
the use of a web address (URL) is insufficient.
Multiple websites can contain the same baseprint,
and no one website is the definitive source.
Instead of referencing a web address,
baseprints are referenced with an intrinsic identifier,
such as a Software Heritage ID (SWHID)
[@cosmo_referencing_2020] [@dicosmo:hal-01865790].
The identity of a baseprint is determined by its exact digital encoding.
If a baseprint is composed of a single file, the digital encoding is a sequence of bytes. If a baseprint is composed of a directory of files,
the digital encoding can be a git tree.
