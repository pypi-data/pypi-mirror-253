Research communication requires bibliographic references.
Bibliographic references identify research documents.
The identity of a baseprint is not based on a single authority.
Multiple websites can present a baseprint.
No single website is the authoritative source of a baseprint.

Baseprints are identified by an intrinsic identifier,
such as a Software Heritage ID (SWHID).
The identity of a baseprint is determined by the exact digital encoding of the baseprint.
The exact digital encoding is a sequence of bytes
when a baseprint is a single file.
Other digital encodings are possible,
such as a *git tree* which encodes a directory of files.
