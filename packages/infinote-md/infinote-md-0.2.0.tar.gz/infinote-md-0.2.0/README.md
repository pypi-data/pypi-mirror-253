# Infinote

*Feel the spatial freedom in your notes.*

## Instalation

```bash
pipx install infinote-md
```

## Runninng

```
infinote PATH_TO_YOUR_NOTES/WORKSPACE/GROUP
```

(Necessary folders will be created.)

F.e.:
```
infinote ~/cloud/notes/astrophysics/$(date +%Y.%m)
```

Here `~/cloud/notes` is your notes dir, `astrophysics` is the workspace name, and `$(+%Y.%m)` is the autogenerated group name of the form `2024.01`. Every group will have different color. You can only edit the group you specified while starting up infinote.

## Troubleshooting

If program hangs during opening, check if vim can open your .md notes. There may be some lingering swap files that you'll need to delete. Or simply copy your note folder to a new location and see if it opens there.
