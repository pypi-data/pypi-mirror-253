## Typing stubs for python-slugify

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`python-slugify`](https://github.com/un33k/python-slugify) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`python-slugify`.

This version of `types-python-slugify` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `python-slugify==8.0.2`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/python-slugify. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `python-slugify` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 8.0.2. Please uninstall the `types-python-slugify`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `7c2d0f1a50775abcdb67ecb2dd51fa888f67eda2` and was tested
with mypy 1.8.0, pyright 1.1.342, and
pytype 2023.12.18.
