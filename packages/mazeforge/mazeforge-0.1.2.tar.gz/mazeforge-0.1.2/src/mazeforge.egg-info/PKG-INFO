## Documentation

### mazeforge.generate

`mazeforge.generate` generates a perfect maze. This means that any two cells are connected by one single unique path. The function returns 2d numpy array. Walls are represented as a `1` and corridor as a `0`. The maze is generated using the prim's algorithm.
