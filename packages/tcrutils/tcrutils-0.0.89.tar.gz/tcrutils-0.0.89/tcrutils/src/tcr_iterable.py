  Returns a list of splits of the original `it` Iterable that was passed in, split every `n` items. Last group may be smaller than `n` items if the source was exhausted
  `back_to_front`: makes the items pile up in the back and now the first item is the one to have less than n items if there's not enough to pack it with. For example:
  - `batched("1234567890", n=3)                    ` returns `["123", "456", "789", "0"]`
