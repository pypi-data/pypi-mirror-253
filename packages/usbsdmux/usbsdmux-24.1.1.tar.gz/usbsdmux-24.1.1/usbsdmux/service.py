This service was intended as systemd-socket-activated unit and provided an
interface to the USB-SD-Mux without the need for root privileges.

Usage of this service became obsolete in new releases that changed the
way the /dev/sg* devices are accessed and that added new udev rules to
directly grant device access to the users.

This file is kept here to notify users that have set up a systemd service.
