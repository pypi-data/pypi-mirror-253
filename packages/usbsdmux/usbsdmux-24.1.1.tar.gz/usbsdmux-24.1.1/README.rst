Welcome to usbsdmux

Purpose
-------
This software is used to control a special piece of hardware called usb-sd-mux from the command line or python.

The usb-sd-mux is build around a `Microchip USB2642 <http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/USB2642>`_ card reader. Thus most of this software deals with interfacing this device using Linux ioctls().

This software is aimed to be used with `Labgrid <https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid>`_. But it can also be used stand-alone or in your own applications.

High-Level Functions
--------------------
usbsdmux provides the following functions:

* Multiplexing the SD-Card to either DUT, Host or disconnect with ``usbsdmux``
* Writing the Configuration-EEPROM of the USB2642 from the command line to customize the representation of the USB device: ``usbsdmux-configure``


Low-Level Functions
-------------------
Under the hood this tool provides interfaces to access the following features of the Microchip USB2642:

* Accessing the auxiliary I2C bus with write and write-read transactions with up to 512 bytes of payload using a simple python interface.
* Writing an I2C Configuration-EEPROM on the configuration I2C.
  This is done using an undocumented command that was reverse-engineered from Microchip's freely available EOL-Tools.

Packages

This tool is `packaged <https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=usbsdmux&searchon=names&exact=1>`_ in Debian 12
(aka *bookworm*) and later.
The package ships the ``usbsdmux`` tool and the corresponding *udev* -rules.
So you can simply ``apt install usbsdmux`` and skip all installation steps below.

Packages also exist for `some other distributions <https://repology.org/project/usbsdmux/versions>`_.

Quickstart
----------

Create and activate a virtualenv for usbsdmux:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ virtualenv -p python3 venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate

Install usbsdmux into the virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install usbsdmux

Now you can run ``usbsdmux -h`` to get a list of possible
command invocations:

.. code-block:: text

   $ usbsdmux -h
   usage: usbsdmux [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--json]
                   SG {get,dut,client,host,off,gpio,info} ...

   positional arguments:
     SG                    /dev/sg* to use
     {get,dut,client,host,off,gpio,info}
                           Supply one of the following commands to interact with the device
       get                 Read the current state of the USB-SD-Mux
       dut                 Switch to the DUT
       client              Switch to the DUT
       host                Switch to the host
       off                 Disconnect from host and DUT
       gpio                Manipulate a GPIO (open drain output only)
       info                Show information about the SD card

   options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --config CONFIG       Set config file location
     --json                Format output as json. Useful for scripting.

Using as root
-------------
If you just want to try the USB-SD-Mux (or maybe if it is just ok for you) you
can just use ``usbsdmux`` as root.

If you have installed this tool inside a virtualenv you can just call the
shell-wrapper along with the appropriate `/dev/sg*` device path:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo /path/to/virtualenv/bin/usbsdmux /dev/sg0 dut
   sudo /path/to/virtualenv/bin/usbsdmux /dev/sg0 host

Using as normal user / Reliable names
-------------------------------------

The example udev-rule in ``contrib/udev/99-usbsdmux.rules`` serves two purposes:

* Allow users currently logged into the system and users in the
  ``plugdev`` group [1]_ to access connected USB-SD-Muxes.
* Create a reliable path in the filesystem to access specific
  USB-SD-Muxes based on their pre-programmed unique serial number.
  This is useful when multiple USB-SD-Muxes are connect to a system,
  as the enumeration-order, and thus the ``/dev/sg*`` numbering,
  may differ between reboots.
  The serial number is printed on a label attached to the device.

Users of a Debian based distribution [1]_ can install the udev rule
by cloning this repository and copying it to the appropriate location
and reloading the active udev rules:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone "https://github.com/linux-automation/usbsdmux.git"
   $ sudo cp usbsdmux/contrib/udev/99-usbsdmux.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
   $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

After reattaching the USB-SD-Mux you should get a list of connected USB-SD-Muxes,
based on their unique serial numbers, by listing the contents of
the ``/dev/usb-sd-mux/`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls -l /dev/usb-sd-mux/
    total 0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root plugdev 6 Mar 31 11:21 id-000000000042 -> ../sg3
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root plugdev 6 Mar 27 00:33 id-000000000078 -> ../sg2
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root plugdev 6 Mar 24 09:51 id-000000000378 -> ../sg1

.. [1] The ``plugdev`` group is used in Debian and Debian based distributions
       (like Ubuntu and Linux Mint) to grant access to pluggable gadgets.
       Depending on your Linux distribution you may want to create/use another
       group for this purpose and adapt the ``udev`` rule accordingly.

Troubleshooting
---------------

* Some single board computers, especially Raspberry Pi model 4s, do not work with
  new/fast micro SD cards, due to drive strength issues at high frequencies.
  Use old and slow micro SD cards with these devices.
  Another workaround is the replacement of resistors ``R101`` and ``R102`` with 0Î©
  parts. This modifications does however void the EMC compliance statement provided
  by the Linux Automation GmbH.
* Some usecases, like hard to reach connectors or full-size SD cards, necessitate the
  use of adapters or extension cables, leading to the same drive strength issues
  and require the same workarounds as documented above.
* In order for the ``/dev/sg*`` device to appear the ``sg`` kernel module needs to be loaded
  into the kernel. This is usually done automatically by ``udev`` once the USB-SD-Mux is connected.
  To manually load the kernel module run ``sudo modprobe sg``.

To enable this function create a config file at ``/etc/usbsdmux.config`` or use ``--config`` specify a file location.

See example config file `usbsdmux.config <contrib/usbsdmux.config>`_.
