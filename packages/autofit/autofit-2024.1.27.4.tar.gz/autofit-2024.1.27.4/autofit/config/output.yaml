# Determines whether files saved by the search are output to the hard-disk. This is true both when saving to the
# directory structure and when saving to database.

# Files can be listed name: bool where the name is the name of the file without a suffix (e.g. model not model.json)
# and bool is true or false.

# If a given file is not listed then the default value is used.

default: true # If true then files which are not explicitly listed here are output anyway. If false then they are not.
