---

Small Python script opening any web page in dedicated window, using embedded QT WebEngine. There are
no visible browser's UI etc, so the that can be useful to turn any website into standalone desktop
application. This is useful if you, as me, would like to have a website run as standalone app,
independently of your main browser which can be beneficial as it gives you separate entry in
window manager or task switcher etc.

> **IMPORTANT:** This tool is **NOT** turning websites into OFFLINE apps! It's about separating
> each of your key websites i.e. from each other, or gazzilions of your browser's tabs. But you
> still MUST be connected to the Internet for the apps (websites) to work as previously.

## Installation

Use `pip` to install the script:

```bash
$ pip install website-as-app
```

Once app is running, please use `--help` to see all available options, as i.e. custom icon,
window title etc.

## Usage

```bash
$ webapp "https://github.com"
```

Available options:

```bash
webapp -h
usage: webapp [--profile PROFILE] [--name NAME] [--icon ICON] [--zoom ZOOM] [--no-tray] url

Open any website in standalone window (like it's an app)

positional arguments:
url                   The URL to open

options:
--profile PROFILE     Profile name (for cookies isolation etc). Default: "default"
--name NAME, -n NAME  Application name (shown as window title)
--geometry GEOMETRY   Initial window geometry (in format "WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y")
--icon ICON, -i ICON  Full path to image file to be used as app icon
--zoom ZOOM, -z ZOOM  Initial WebBrowserView zoom factor. Default: 1.0
--no-tray             Disables system tray support (closing window terminates app)
```

The most important option is `--profile` which allows you to isolate cookies and app settings
per instance. Any instance using the same profile will have access to the same cookies and
settings. This is useful if you want to run multiple instances of the same app, but with
different accounts. By default `default` profile is used and it's recommended to use different
profile per each app instance.

## Current limitations

* Due to security based limitations of embedded `QWebBrowerView` you will not be able
  to save any file to your local storage nor filesystem.
* Website's Javascript code cannot write to system clipboard so you migth need to manually
  select given portion of the site and copy using function from context menu as any buttons
  on the page that is using JS to write to the host's clipboard will not currently work.
