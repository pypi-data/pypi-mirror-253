# Wallpaper Group Symmetry Dataset

## Introduction
The Wallpaper Group Symmetry Dataset project provides a comprehensive toolkit for generating and analyzing datasets based on the mathematical theory of wallpaper groups. This project is rooted in the intricate study of plane symmetry groups, offering a rich exploration of the 17 distinct categories of symmetrical patterns achievable through combinations of translation, reflection, glide reflection, and rotational operations. Aimed at mathematicians, computer scientists, data analysts, and educational professionals, this project bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theory and practical dataset generation.

## Features
This project offers a robust set of features designed to facilitate the study and application of wallpaper group symmetries:
- **Dataset Generation:** Users can generate datasets categorizing the 17 distinct wallpaper symmetry types, each defined by unique combinations of symmetry operations including translations, mirrors, glides, and rotations (2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold).
- **Example Notebooks:** Included Jupyter notebooks serve as comprehensive guides, illustrating the steps to generate example images and datasets, thereby demystifying the complex mathematical concepts behind wallpaper group symmetries.
- **Statistical Evaluation:** Tools for evaluating and understanding the statistical properties of the generated datasets, enabling in-depth analysis and research.

## Usage
The project includes several Jupyter notebooks designed to showcase the generation and analysis of wallpaper symmetry datasets:
- **Generating Example Images:** Learn how to create visually captivating images that represent each of the 17 symmetry types.
- **Creating Example Datasets:** Step-by-step guide to compiling datasets based on specified symmetry criteria.
- **Dataset Statistics:** Techniques for analyzing and interpreting the statistical aspects of the datasets, offering insights into the distribution and characteristics of the symmetry types.
