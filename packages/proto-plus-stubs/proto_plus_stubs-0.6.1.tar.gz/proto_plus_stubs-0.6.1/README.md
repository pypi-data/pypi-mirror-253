# Type stubs for proto-plus-stubs
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/proto-plus-stubs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/proto-plus-stubs)

This package provides type stubs for the [proto-plus](https://pypi.org/project/proto-plus/) package. It allows you to type check usage of the library with e.g. [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and will also improve autocomplete in many editors.

**This is in no way affiliated with Google.**

The stubs were originally created by [stubgen](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html), but have seen some manual improvements since then. Further contributions are welcome.

## Installation
```shell script
$ pip install proto-plus-stubs
```
The stubs should be automatically picked up by your editor or typechecker.
