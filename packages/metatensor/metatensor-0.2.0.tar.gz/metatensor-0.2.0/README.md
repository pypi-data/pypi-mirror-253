Metatensor is a self-describing sparse tensor data format for atomistic machine
learning and beyond; storing values and gradients of these values together.
Think numpy `ndarray` or pytorch `Tensor` equipped with extra metadata for
atomic systems and other point clouds data. The core of this library is written
in Rust and we provide API for C, C++, and Python.

The main class of metatensor is the `TensorMap` data structure, defining a
custom block-sparse data format. If you are using metatensor from Python, we
additionally provide a collection of mathematical, logical and other utility
operations to make working with TensorMaps more convenient.
