            positions of all particles in the system.

            the system. Each row should be one of the bounding box vector; and columns
            should contain the x, y, and z components of these vectors (i.e. the cell
            should be given in row-major order). Systems are assumed to obey periodic
            boundary conditions, non-periodic systems should set the cell to 0.
