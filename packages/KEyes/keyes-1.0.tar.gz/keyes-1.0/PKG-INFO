Oh my GOD what is this?
=======================

![Aaron Seigo is watching you code](https://github.com/pvaret/keyes/blob/main/screenshots/keyes.gif?raw=true)

The most important productivity app you didn't know you were missing.

It allows the KDE e.v. board from 2007-2008 to watch you work and silently judge
you. See if Aaron Seigo's slight frown doesn't guilt you into coding a million
times better.


That sounds awesome. How do I run it?
=====================================

Install Python. Install PySide6. Run `KEyes.py`. That's it.


Boring stuff
============

Pictures are from the KDE e.v. web site and some sort of copyright certainly
applies. KEyes.py is licensed under the GPL3 so if you want to make it
*even better somehow*, you can.
