# Logbox

This package is a Python tool for handling terminal outputs.
Optionally, the terminal outputs are simultaneously logged to a file.

Some features:
* [Iterators](docs/Iterators.md) that automatically show a progress bar in the terminal
* High-level usage of color codes
* [Channels](docs/Channels.md) for writing to different log-files and adding additional information to terminal outputs
