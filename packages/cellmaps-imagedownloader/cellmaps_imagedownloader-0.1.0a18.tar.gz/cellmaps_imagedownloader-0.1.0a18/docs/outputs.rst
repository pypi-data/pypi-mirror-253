=======
Outputs
=======

The tool creates several files and folders in the specified output directory.
Below is the list and description of each output generated by the tool.

- ``1_image_gene_node_attributes.tsv``:
    A TSV file containing attributes for image genes generated during the first fold of execution. ``2_image_gene_node_attributes.tsv`` corresponds
    to the second fold of execution etc.

- ``samples.csv``:
    A CSV_ copy of file passed in via ``--samples`` flag. This file will only
    be created if the ``--samples`` flag is set.

- ``samplescopy.csv``:
    A CSV_ file generated from data passed in via ``--cm4ai_table`` flag.
    This file will only be created if the flag is set.

- ``unique.csv``:
    A CSV_ file that is a copy of the file passed in via ``--unique`` flag.
    This file will only be created if the ``--unique`` flag is set.

- ``uniquecopy.csv``:
    A CSV_ file that is generated from data passed in via ``--cm4ai_table`` flag.
    This file will only be created if the flag is set.

- ``blue``, ``red``, ``green``, ``yellow``:
    Directories containing downloaded images in different color spectrum.

- ``proteinatlas.xml.gz``:
    A gzipped XML file containing information fetched from the `Human Protein Atlas`_.

Logs and Metadata
-----------------

- ``image_gene_node_attributes.errors``:
    Logs any errors encountered during the creation of image gene node attributes.

- ``output.log``:
    A standard log file recording events, errors, and other messages during the execution of the tool.

- ``error.log``:
    A specialized log file recording only error messages encountered during the execution of the tool.

- ``ro-crate-metadata.json``:
    Metadata in RO-Crate_ format, a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata.

    The main object contains identifier (@id), type (@type), name, descriptions, keywords and isPartOf, that describes the hierarchical relationship (organization and project).

    Graph: The @graph key contains an array of objects that detail other entities related to the main dataset.
    a. Metadata, Datasets, Software
    b. Output Files: details of output files generated by the tool.
    c. Images: details about specific image files, including keywords, descriptions, formats, and content URLs.
