# Traffic Analysis of Fluctuating Flows (TAFFy)

## About

Network and security operators are continually bombarded by strange
deviations in network traffic that are sometimes operationally
problematic, sometimes a threat to security, and other times just
plain odd.  Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a tool that accurately
tells you exactly what has changed in these traffic profiles?
This tool is designed to do just that.

## Installation
