        See how to use the official Trafilatura API to download or extract data for free or for larger volumes.


Introduction
------------

Use the last version of the software straight from the application programming interface. This is especially useful if you want to try out Trafilatura without installing it or if you want to support the project while saving time.

- Fast URL download, or use HTML file as input
- Configurable output


Endpoints
---------

The official API comes in two versions, available from two different gateways:

- `Free for demonstration purposes <https://trafilatura.mooo.com>`_ (including documentation page)
- `For a larger volume of requests <https://rapidapi.com/trafapi/api/trafilatura>`_ (documentation and plans)



Further information
-------------------

The API is still an early-stage product and the code is currently not available under an open-source license.
