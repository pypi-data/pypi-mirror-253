TREVORproxy_serverless
==

<br/>

Sets up an autoscaling fargate cluster of SOCKS proxies to use along with [TREVORproxy](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/TREVORproxy).

`trevorproxy_serverless` puts a `proxy-intent` message in an sqs queue which causes the proxy cluster to scale up if it is not already up.

when stopped `trevorproxy_serverless` deletes the `proxy-intent` message to signal that it does not need the proxies anymore.

the sqs queue has a message retention limit which acts as a hard timeout to prevent proxies from running too long.

the message retention & proxy count can be adjusted trough [terraform variables](https://github.com/aristosMiliaressis/TREVORproxy_serverless/blob/master/infra/variables.tf).

**Dependencies for infra.sh**
- aws cli (configured with enough permissions)
- terraform
- docker
- jq

<br/>

**trevorproxy_serverless Installation**
```bash
$ pip install trevorproxy_serverless
```

<br/>

**Notes**

Cost of one proxy instance running for an hour is 0,012$.

PS: Fargate bills per minute spent so if you spin up 100 servers for 30 minutes it will cost 0,012 * 100 / 2 = 0,60$

PS: Spin up time can take a few minutes because SQS pushes metrics to cloudwatch on an interval of 1 or 5 minues, the following aws regions support [1 minute metrics](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/12/amazon-sqs-now-supports-1-minute-cloudwatch-metrics/), so they are recommended:
US East (Ohio), 
EU (Ireland), 
EU (Stockholm), 
Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
