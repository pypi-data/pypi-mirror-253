---

OpenTTDLab is a Python framework for using [OpenTTD](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD) to run reproducible experiments and extracting results from them, with as few manual steps as possible.

OpenTTDLab is based on [Patric Stout's OpenTTD Savegame Reader](https://github.com/TrueBrain/OpenTTD-savegame-reader).

> [!NOTE]
> Work in progress. Only some of the things in this README will work: it serves as a rough design spec.


## Installation

OpenTTDLab is distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/OpenTTDLab/), and so can usually be installed using pip.

```shell
python -m pip install OpenTTDLab
```

When run on macOS, OpenTTDLab has a dependency that pip does not install: [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). To install 7-zip, first install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and then use Homebrew to install the p7zip package that contains 7-zip.

```shell
brew install p7zip
```

You do not need to separately download or install OpenTTD (or [OpenGFX](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenGFX)) in order to use OpenTTDLab. OpenTTDLab itself handles downloading them.


## Running an experiment

The core function of OpenTTD is the `run_experiment` function.

```python
from openttdlab import run_experiment, remote_file, save_config

# Run the experiment for a range of random seeds
results, config = run_experiment(
    days=365 * 4 + 1,
    seeds=range(0, 10),
    ais=(
        # remote_file: takes a url of a .tar.gz AI file
        # local_file: takes a path to a local .tar AI file
        ('trAIns', remote_file('https://github.com/lhrios/trains/archive/refs/tags/2014_02_14.tar.gz')),
    ),
)

# Print the results...
print(results)

# ... and config
print(config)

# ... which can be saved to a file and then shared (or archived)
save_config('my-experiment-{experiment_id}.yml', config)
```


## Plotting results

OpenTTD does not require any particular library for plotting results. However, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) are common options for plotting from Python. For example if you have a `results` object from `run_experiment` as in the above example, the following code

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

df = pd.DataFrame(results)
df = df.pivot(index='date', columns='seed', values='money')
fig = px.line(df)
fig.show()
```

should output a plot much like this one.

## Reproducing an experiment

If you have the config from a previous experiment, you can pass it into `run_experiment` to exactly reproduce. If for some reason it cannot be reproduced, it will error.

```python
from openttdlab import run_experiment, load_config

# Load the config from a file...
config = load_config('my-config-a5e95018.yml')

# ... and use it to run the same experiment
results, config = run_experiment(config=config)

print(results)
```


## Compatibility

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04), Windows (tested on Windows Server 2019), or macOS (tested on macOS 11)
- Python >= 3.8.0 (tested on 3.8.0 and 3.12.0)
