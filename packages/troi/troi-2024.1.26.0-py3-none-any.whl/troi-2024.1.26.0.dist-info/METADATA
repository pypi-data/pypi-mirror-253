# Introduction

This project aims to create an open source music recommendation toolkit with an API-first
philiosophy. API-first means that user do no need to download a lot of data before they
can start working with Troi -- all the needed data should ideally live in online APIs, making
it very easy for someone to get started hacking on music recommendations.

To accomplish this goal, we, the MetaBrainz Foundation, have created and hosted a number of data-sets
that can be accessed as a part of this project. For instance, the more stable APIs are hosted on our
[Labs API page](https://labs.api.listenbrainz.org).

The ListenBrainz project offers a number of data sets:

1. Collaborative filtered recordings that suggest what recordings a user should listen to based on
their previous listening habits.
2. User statistics that were derived from users recent listening habits.

We will continue to build and host more datasets as time passes. If an API endpoint becomes useful to
a greater number of people we will elevate these API endpoints to officially supported endpoints
that we ensure are up to date on online at all times.

The project is named after [Deanna Troi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deanna_Troi).

# Documentation

Full documentation for Troi is available at [troi.readthedocs.org](https://troi.readthedocs.org).


## Installation for end users

So far we've not uploaded Troi bundles to PyPi -- please use the installation instructions for developers
below.

## Installation for Development

**Linux and Mac**

```
virtualenv -p python3 .ve
source .ve/bin/activate
pip3 install .[tests]
troi --help
```

**Windows**

```
virtualenv -p python .ve
.ve\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install .[tests]
troi --help
```

## Basic commands

List available patches:

    troi list

Generate a playlist using a patch:

    troi playlist --print [patch-name]

If the patch requires arguments, running it with no arguments will print a usage statement, e.g.

    $ troi playlist --print area-random-recordings
    Usage: area-random-recordings [OPTIONS] AREA START_YEAR END_YEAR
   
      Generate a list of random recordings from a given area.
   
      AREA is a MusicBrainz area from which to choose tracks.
      START_YEAR is the start year.
      END_YEAR is the end year.
   
    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.

## Running tests

```
troi test
troi test -v
troi test -v <file to test>
```

## Building Documentation

To build the documentation locally:

    pip install .[docs]
    cd docs
    make clean html

## References for the future path of Troi

Troi is a rather primitive tool at this point in time, but as the MetaBrainz projects gather more data, we can improve
how we generate playlists. A good overview of the technology and psychology behind playlists and recommendations, see:
