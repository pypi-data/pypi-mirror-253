"""Mox, an object-mocking framework for Python.

Mox works in the record-replay-verify paradigm.  When you first create
a mock object, it is in record mode.  You then programmatically set
the expected behavior of the mock object (what methods are to be
called on it, with what parameters, what they should return, and in
what order).

Once you have set up the expected mock behavior, you put it in replay
mode.  Now the mock responds to method calls just as you told it to.
If an unexpected method (or an expected method with unexpected
parameters) is called, then an exception will be raised.

Once you are done interacting with the mock, you need to verify that
all the expected interactions occured.  (Maybe your code exited
prematurely without calling some cleanup method!)  The verify phase
ensures that every expected method was called; otherwise, an exception
will be raised.

WARNING! Mock objects created by Mox are not thread-safe.  If you are
call a mock in multiple threads, it should be guarded by a mutex.

TODO(stevepm): Add the option to make mocks thread-safe!

Suggested usage / workflow:

  # Create Mox factory
  my_mox = Mox()

  # Create a mock data access object
  mock_dao = my_mox.create_mock(DAOClass)

  # Set up expected behavior
  mock_dao.retrieve_person_with_identifier("1").and_return(person)
  mock_dao.delete_person(person)

  # Put mocks in replay mode
  my_mox.replay_all()

  # Inject mock object and run test
  controller.set_dao(mock_dao)
  controller.delete_person_by_id("1")

  # Verify all methods were called as expected
  my_mox.verify_all()
