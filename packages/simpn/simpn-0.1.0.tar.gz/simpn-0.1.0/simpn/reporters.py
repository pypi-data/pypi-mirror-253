    initial_time moment in calendar time from which the simulation time will be measured.
    A particular simulation_time moment will then be stored in the log as:
    initial_time + simulation_time timeunits. Data can also be reported on by specifying the
    corresponding data fields. The names of these data fields must correspond to names of data fields as
    they appear in the problem.
