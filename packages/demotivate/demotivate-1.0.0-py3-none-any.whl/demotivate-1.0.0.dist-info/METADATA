# demotivate

A simple script to print random demotivations.

Inspired by depression and the simple script [motivate](https://github.com/mubaris/motivate), which was inspired by
[forture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)), of which you have ill.

**But seriously,** don't let the intrusive thoughts win, if you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts or
a crisis, please reach out immediately to your local crisis helpline or [find a helpline](https://findahelpline.com/).


## Features

- Supports `bash`, `zsh` and probably others, but I couldn't be bothered to test.
- ``import demotivate; demotivate.demotivate()`` will give you some sad text, or something.
- A bunch of quotes, add more, or don't.


## Getting Started

- Install

    ```console
    
    $ pip install demotivate
    
    ```

- Run

    ```console
    
    $ demotivate

    Life. What a fucking nighmare.
    
    ```

- Profit?
