# STEM: Soil and Track System Modeling Tool

![Tests](https://github.com/StemVibrations/STEM/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/stemvibrations/badge/?version=latest)](https://stemvibrations.readthedocs.io/badge=latest)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/stemvibrations/stem/graph/badge.svg?token=0DMYCZF4BU)](https://codecov.io/gh/stemvibrations/stem)

The STEM model is designed to create and analyse models of soil and track systems.
The tool provides a set of commands for creating the geometry of the model, defining the soil and track properties, setting the boundary conditions and loads, generating the mesh, and performing post-processing on the results.

## Installation

STEM can be downloaded and installed on any system that supports Python.
To install the STEM, follow the following steps:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/StemVibrations/STEM.git
```

It is also needed to download Kratos Multiphysics. Kratos Multiphysics can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/StemVibrations/StemKratos).

Further details about the installation can be found [here](https://stemvibrations.readthedocs.io/).

## Usage

To use STEM please refer to the tutorials available [here](https://stemvibrations.readthedocs.io/).
