class TestProducerMaxProfile(TestCase):
    """
    A test to verify that the producer can have a given scaled profile, where the producer will
    always produce equal or less than said profile. This constraint is checked for a producer,
    where the producer's profile was also intentionally reduced for a couple of time-steps
    (reducing the profile value at a few time steps).

    Checks:
    - Demand matching
    - check that heat_source <= scaled_profile * size_source.

    Missing:
    - Use standard checks.
