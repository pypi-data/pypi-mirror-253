According to Wikipedia:
: An *odometer* or *odograph* is an instrument used for measuring the distance traveled by a vehicle, such as a bicycle or car. The device may be electronic, mechanical, or a combination of the two. The noun derives from ancient Greek **ὁδόμετρον**, **hodómetron**, from **ὁδός**, **hodós** and **μέτρον**, **métron**.

When you take a look at how it behaves, you come up with the following:

> - a sequence of *displays*
>   > - each individual *display* show a *value* from a *predefined list of ordered values*
>   > - the displayed value *rotates* over the predefined list of ordered values
>   >   > - each full rotation of a *display* affects the rotation of its neighbour

The predefined list of ordered values in a traditional odometer is composed of the decimal digits 0 to 9.
However this list can technically be anything you want it to be:

> - characters
> - words
> - names of days of the week
> - months
> - …

It is exactly that kind of functionality odometer aim to provide.

## Installation

### Requirements

See [Requirements for Installing Packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-requirements) for
instructions on how to install python packages in general.

### Installing from PyPI

To install the latest version of odometer:

Unix/macOS

```bash
python3 -m pip install odometer
```

Windows

```bat
py -m pip install odometer
```

To install a specific version:

Unix/macOS

```bash
python3 -m pip install odometer==1.4
```

Windows

```bat
py -m pip install odometer==1.4
```

To install greater than or equal to one version and less than another:

Unix/macOS

```bash
python3 -m pip install odometer>=1,<2
```

Windows

```bat
py -m pip install odometer>=1,<2
```

To install a version that’s [compatible](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers-compatible-release)
with a certain version: 

Unix/macOS

```bash
python3 -m pip install odometer~=1.4.2
```

Windows

```bat
py -m pip install odometer~=1.4.2
```

In this case, this means to install any version “==1.4.\*” version that’s also
“>=1.4.2”.
