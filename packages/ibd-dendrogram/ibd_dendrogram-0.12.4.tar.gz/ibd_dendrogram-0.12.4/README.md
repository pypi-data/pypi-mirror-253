# ibd-dendrogram:

A python module to help users create a distance matrix and construct a dendrogram using Identity by Descent segments as a distance marker. The default distance is calculated as 1/(shared ibd segment length). Documentation explaining the api can be found here: [ibd-dendrogram docs](https://ibd-dendrogram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

This module has four accessible methods: make_distance_matrix, record_matrix, generate_dendrogram, draw_dendrogram.
