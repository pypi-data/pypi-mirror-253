# Topsis Implementation
This package is used for topsis implementation, published by Kashish, roll number- 102117150, group- 3CS6.
## Overview
This Python package implements the Topsis (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) algorithm. Topsis is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that helps in choosing the best alternative from a set of alternatives based on their performance on multiple criteria.

## Installation
To install the package, use the following command:
pip install topsis-Kashish-102117150

## Usage
In the terminal,
python 102117150.py 102117150-data.csv "1,1,1,1,1" "+,-,+,-,+" 102117150-result.csv
where,
input_data.csv: The input CSV file containing the decision matrix. You can use the file 102117150-data.csv .
"1,1,1,1,1": Comma-separated weights for each criterion.
"+,-,+,-,+": Comma-separated impacts for each criterion (either '+' or '-').
output_result.csv: The desired name for the output CSV file containing Topsis scores and ranks. You can see the results in file- 102117150-result-1.csv for the respective weights and impacts.
