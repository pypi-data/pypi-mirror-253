## trans client 

### Introduction

â€‹	A tool based on scp for quickly transmitting data on a server. If you

do not want to enter the account password during the transmission process,

please configure the ssh key in advance. This is a client-side script. If

you have set up your own LAN server as a backup server or data transfer

station, you can install the trans-server script on the server side.
