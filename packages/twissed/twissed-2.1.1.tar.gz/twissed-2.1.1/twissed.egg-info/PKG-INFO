# Twissed

## Overview

Twissed is a Python package üêç that provides a large number of data analysis tools for **beam dynamics** and **laser wakefield acceleration** simulations.

Twissed is multi-OS (Windows, Linux, Mac) and can be easily installed everywhere thanks to its low number of dependencies (numpy, pandas, scipy, h5py). It is especially made to run on HPC clusters. 

Twissed can read and write data from several sources

* [FBPIC](https://fbpic.github.io/)
* [Smilei](https://smileipic.github.io/Smilei/)
* [Smilei via happi package](https://smileipic.github.io/Smilei/)
* [TraceWin](https://dacm-logiciels.fr/)
* [Astra]()

## Installation
