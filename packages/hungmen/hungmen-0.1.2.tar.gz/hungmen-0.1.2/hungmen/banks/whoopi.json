  "Art and life are subjective. Not everybody's gonna dig what I dig, but I reserve the right to dig it.",
  "We're here for a reason. I believe a bit of the reason is to throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.",
  "I don't have pet peeves like some people. I have whole kennels of irritation.",
  "Normal is just a cycle on the washing machine.",
  "Now, I've always known that there were bullies in the world. We've seen a lot of it in politics lately as well as in daily life. You see it where people who may be stronger, or bigger, or better with verbiage than other folks... show off. To me, that's what bullying is, showing off. It's saying, I'm better than you, I can take you down. Not just physically, but emotionally.",
  "I would love to teach every kid to say \"fuck.\" Hang on, now, hang on, listen to why. The reason is because to me, that is a word that doesn't have any effect. But \"stupid\" and \"dummy\"? You can say it to someone who is six and you can say it to someone who is a hundred and six and they will hunch their shoulders and it will be like somebody kicked them in the stomach because they are harsh, ugly words.",

So I called my daughter who is in her 30s now and I said \u201cdo you know what endometriosis is?\u201d She said, \u201cwhat? Have to pack the pack the busters.",
  "The most important thing is that you have to listen to your truths, desires and wants. And you have to believe you deserve all of it.",
  "Is there any forgiveness? If somebody does something wrong, we now have copped this \"off with the head\" attitude, which, I confess, feels great sometimes, but come on. Why do we paint everyone with the same brush? Why does it seem more & more we want people ruined rather than rehabilitated?",
  "We forgive sometimes, and sometimes we don't. One thing that's consistent is, at least in the early going, we love to punish and we need to find a villian.",
  "I can do anything. I can be anything. No one ever told me I couldn't. No one ever expressed this idea that I was limited to any one thing, and so I think in terms of what's possible, not impossible.",
  "People have the power we give them. Words have the power we give them.",
