Description: Backup or Clean Reddit Account
        ==============================
        
        Info:
        ~~~~~
        
        **[Backup]**: With this functionality you can export all your
        subreddits. Sometimes you need a new account but want to keep all the
        subs you follow. Most of the time this is a boring job.
        
        **[Clean]**: With this functionality you can remove all your activity
        for example delete all the comments you have done or all the posts you
        have created. People tell personal information that can lead to someone
        that knows them or recognize them. Lot of people say or posts things in
        Reddit that in person no one knows. (Actions can’t be undone)
        
        **[Confuse]**: Replace your comments and posts text (not title). This is
        helpful since deleted comments can still be viewed. Results look like
        screenshot at the end of page. Actions can’t be undone in most cases
        unless Rollback functionality is activated with while confusing.
        
        | **[Rollback]**: If you changed your mind and you want to return back
          the confused items to their original state, rollback can do this.
        | *Disclaimer: Rollback still can fail due to varius reasons like
          removed item, locked account etc.*
        
        --------------
        
        Installation:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
           git clone https://github.com/tsaklidis/subreddits.git cd subreddits pip install -r requirements.txt 
        
        Prepare:
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        First you need to set the praw.ini file.
        
        -  Rename the **praw.ini.example** to **praw.ini** after that create a
           Reddit app. In order to ask the Reddit for data you need an app so
           use the following link: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
        -  Fill a name for the app. The type should be set to script and
           redirect uri http://localhost:8080 The script will be working
           locally, no worries for the uri.
        -  After creating the app we need the credentials. **client_id** is
           right under the app name and **client_secret** is the secret key.
        -  Get credentials for old and new accounts.
        -  Fill the data in praw.ini file
        
        --------------

        Export and Import with one run
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
           python3 src/main.py -o 
        
        --------------
        
        Confuse all your activity
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        | You will be guided through questions what you want to confuse.
        | Comments or submissions (posts), bulk or single action
        
        ::
        
           python3 src/cleaner.py -c 
        
        Use ``-rlb`` option in case you would like use the Rollback feature and
        restore the confused items
        
        ::
        
           python3 src/cleaner.py -c -rlb 
        
        --------------
        
        Rollback the confused items
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you changed your mind and you want back your original
        comments/submissions you can use the rollback feature. The rollback is
        available only if you confused **WITH** -rlb option.
        
        ::
        
           python3 src/rollback.py 
        
        **Delete** all your activity.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You will be asked for comments or submissions (posts)
        
        ::
        
           python3 src/cleaner.py -d
        
        After using the confuser, the results are similar to the screen.
