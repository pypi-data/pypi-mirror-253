We have three types of settings:
- ClientSettings just state defaults for where to store stuff on the client's machine
- LocalConfig is the local config file for a specific project. This may include the project id or anything cached from
recent API calls.
- GlobalConfig is the global config file for the user. This may include auth info, etc.
