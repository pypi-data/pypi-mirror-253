Jaxampler ðŸ§ª is a statistical sampling toolkit built on top of JAX. It provides a set of high-performance sampling
algorithms for a wide range of statistical distributions. Jaxampler is designed to be easy to use and integrate with
existing JAX workflows. It is also designed to be extensible, allowing users to easily add new sampling algorithms and
statistical distributions.

Jaxampler is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for production use. However, we welcome
contributions from the community to help us improve the library. If you are interested in contributing, please refer to
our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Features

- ðŸš€ **High-Performance Sampling**: Leverage the power of JAX for high-speed, accurate sampling.
- ðŸ§© **Versatile Algorithms**: A wide range of sampling methods to suit various applications.
- ðŸ”— **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing JAX workflows.

## Install

You may install the latest released version of Jaxampler through pip by doing

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade jaxampler
```

You may install the bleeding edge version by cloning this repo, or doing

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Qazalbash/jaxampler
```

If you would like to take advantage of CUDA, you will additionally need to install a specific version of JAX by doing

```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

## Requirements

Jaxampler requires Python 3.10 or later. It also requires the following packages:

```bash
jax>=0.4.0 
jaxlib>=0.4.0
typing_extensions>=4.5.0
jaxtyping>=0.2.24
matplotlib>=3.8.0
tfp-nightly
tqdm
```

The test suite is based on `pytest`. To run the tests, one needs to install pytest and run `pytest` at the root
directory of this repo.
