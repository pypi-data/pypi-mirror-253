# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Summary ⚠️⚠️⚠️

⚠️⚠️⚠️ The **`omero_slurm_client` PyPI package is deprecated, use `biomero` instead** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

We have renamed the omero_slurm_client package to biomero, to reduce confusion with different names.

Install the latest biomero instead: 
```
pip install biomero
```

Then change your imports to use that package:
```
from biomero import SlurmClient
```

Any new changes, features and bug fixes will only be applied to the `biomero` GitHub and PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/biomero/
