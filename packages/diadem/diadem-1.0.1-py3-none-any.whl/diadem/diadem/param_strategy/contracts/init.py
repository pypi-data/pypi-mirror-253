    Signature contract for the param strategy resolve function.

    This function organizes identified clusters into a structured parameter map, assigning unique and meaningful identifiers to each cluster.

    Args:
        clusters: A list of dictionaries, each representing a cluster of shared attributes.
        cluster_map: A dictionary mapping each cluster index to a tuple of sets containing state IDs and resource references.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are cluster indices and values are unique identifiers (paths) for accessing these clusters in the params structure.
