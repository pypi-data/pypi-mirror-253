Diadem is a Python-based tool designed to streamline cloud resource management by organizing, parametrizing, and visualizing SLS files across various cloud platforms, enhancing both efficiency and security.

About
=====

Diadem offers a comprehensive solution for managing extensive cloud resources.
Built on POP, it integrates seamlessly with Idem, providing a user-friendly interface for handling complex cloud infrastructures.
Its visualization capabilities offer clear insights into resource dependencies, making it an essential tool for modern cloud environments.

What is POP?
------------

This project is built with `pop <https://pop.readthedocs.io/>`__, a Python-based
implementation of *Plugin Oriented Programming (POP)*. POP seeks to bring
together concepts and wisdom from the history of computing in new ways to solve
modern computing problems.

* `Intro to Plugin Oriented Programming (POP) <https://pop-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
* `pop-awesome <https://gitlab.com/vmware/pop/pop-awesome>`__

Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3.10+
* git *(if installing from source, or contributing to the project)*

Installation
------------

.. note::

   If wanting to contribute to the project, and setup your local development
   environment, see the ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` document in the source repository
   for this project.

If wanting to use ``diadem``, you can do so by either
installing from PyPI or from source.

Install from PyPI
+++++++++++++++++

Install diadem with only the "compile" functionality:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install diadem

Install diadem with matplotlib for data visualizations with matplotlib and networkx:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install diadem[visualize]

Install from source
+++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

   # clone repo
   git clone git@gitlab.com:Akm0d/diadem.git
   cd diadem

   # Setup venv
   python3 -m virtualenv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .

Usage
=====

Diadem simplifies the management of cloud resources.
Use it to enumerate resources, organize SLS files, and visualize cloud infrastructure, ensuring efficient and secure cloud operations.

Examples
--------

Enumerate cloud resources with idem describe:

.. code-block:: bash

   idem describe "aws.*" > aws.sls
   idem describe "gitlab.*" > gitlab.sls

Parametrize sls files by creating arg-bind relationships and an SLS tree:

.. code-block:: bash

   idem compile aws.sls gitlab.sls --tree /srv/idem

This reads aws.sls and gitlab.sls into memory onto idem's unified SLS tree.
It then uses diadem to create param files based on similarities between the resource states.
The new parameterized SLS files and param files are then put into the /srv/idem directory.

Visualize relationships between resources using matplotlib:

.. code-block:: bash

   idem view /srv/idem

Run idem state on the newly crafted sls/param trees:

.. code-block:: bash

   idem state --tree /srv/idem
