Byron is an [evolutionary tool](https://cad-polito-it.github.io/byron/evolution): given a problem, it first generates a set of random solutions, then iteratively improves them using the results of their evaluations together with structural information. It may be used as a coverage-driven [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) and a general-purpose [optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_optimization).

**⚠️ Byron is currently in [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) and under active development**

## Installation

As simple as

```
pip install --upgrade byron
```

A few dependencies can enhance Byron functionalities, but are not strictly required. You can get them all with

```
pip install --upgrade "byron[full]"
```

## Documentation

None yet, but some HOWTO's and examples [are available](https://github.com/cad-polito-it/byron/tree/alpha/examples) in the development repo.
