Stable release
--------------

.. warning::

   You need to have graphviz installed for terragraph to work. You can install it
   from here https://graphviz.org/download/. Its not possible for terragraph to
   pull this in automatically.


To install terragraph, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install terragraph

This is the preferred method to install terragraph, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
