Create semi-synthetic time-series based on averaged data.

[documentation](https://netopt.github.io/traffic_weaver/)

## Description

General scope of Traffic Weaver is to read averaged time series and
to create semi-synthetic signal with finer granularity that after averaging
matches the original signal provided.
Following tools are applied to recreate the signal.

* Oversampling with a given strategy
* Stretched to match the integral of the original time series
* Smoothing
* Repeating
* Applying trend
* Adding noise

Below figure illustrates the processing example. Based on provided original averaged
time series
(a), signal is *n*-times oversampled with predefined strategy how to approximate
intermediate points (b). Next, it is stretched to match integral of the original
function (c). Further, it can be smoothened with spline function (d).
Signal can be repeated several times (e) to apply certain long-term trend (f).
Finally, noise can be introduced to signal (g). (h) presents averaged two periods
of created signal to show that they match the original signal.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install package with pip.

`pip install traffic_weaver`

### Minimal processing example

```python
from traffic_weaver import Weaver
from traffic_weaver.datasets import load_mobile_video
from traffic_weaver.array_utils import append_one_sample
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# load exemplary dataset
x, y = load_mobile_video()

# add one sample to the end as file contains averaged values for time intervals
x, y = append_one_sample(x, y, make_periodic=True)

wv = Weaver(x, y)
wv.oversample(12).integral_match().smooth(s=1.0)

# plot original time series
fig, axes = plt.subplots()
axes.plot(*wv.get(), drawstyle="steps-post")
plt.show()

# process time series
wv.repeat(4).trend(lambda x: 0.5 * x).noise(snr=60)

# plot modified time series
fig, axes = plt.subplots()
axes.plot(*wv.get())
plt.show()

# get time series processed data
x, y = wv.get()

# or get them as a spline function to sample any arbitrary point
f = wv.to_function()
# get value at 0.5
f(0.5)
```
