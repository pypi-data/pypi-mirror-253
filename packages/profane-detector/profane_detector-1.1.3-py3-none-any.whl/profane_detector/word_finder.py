    """
    WordFinder is a class designed to find words in a sentence with a given similarity threshold.

    Attributes:
        sentence (str): The input sentence to search for words.
        logger (logging.Logger): A logger for the WordFinder class.

    Methods:
        _clean_sentence(): Cleans the input sentence by removing non-alphabetic characters and converting to lowercase.
        find_words(target_words, similarity_threshold=80): Finds words in the cleaned sentence that match the target words
            based on a similarity threshold.

    Example:
        word_finder = WordFinder("This is a sample sentence.")
        result = word_finder.find_words(["example", "word"])
        print(result)  # Output: {'example'}
