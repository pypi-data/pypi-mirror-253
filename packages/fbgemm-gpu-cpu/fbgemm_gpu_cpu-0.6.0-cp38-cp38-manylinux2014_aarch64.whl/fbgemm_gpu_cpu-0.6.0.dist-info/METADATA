FBGEMM_GPU (FBGEMM GPU Kernels Library) is a collection of high-performance PyTorch
GPU operator libraries for training and inference.  The library provides efficient
table batched embedding bag, data layout transformation, and quantization supports.

FBGEMM_GPU is currently tested with cuda 12.1.0 and 11.8 in CI, and with PyTorch
packages (2.1+) that are built against those CUDA versions.

Only Intel/AMD CPUs with AVX2 extensions are currently supported.

See our [Documentation](docs/README.md) for more information.
