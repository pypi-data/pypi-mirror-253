This is a fork of [DAWG](https://pypi.org/project/DAWG/) project rebuilt
with Python 3.10+ support.

Installation:

    pip install dawg2

But imported name is still `dawg`, not dawg2.

This package provides DAWG
([DAFSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton))-based
dictionary-like read-only objects for Python.

String data in a DAWG may take 200x less memory than in a standard
Python dict and the raw lookup speed is comparable; it also provides
fast advanced methods like prefix search.
