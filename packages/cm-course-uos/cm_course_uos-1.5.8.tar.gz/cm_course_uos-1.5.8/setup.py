    long_description='The package is separated into submodules "ps1","ps2".. which respectively host the code for each problem set. The main reasons this package was created were hiding unnecessary complexity from the students and enabling us to perform automating testing, grading and task aids while discouraging cheating. Cheating is still possible by installing the package and reverse engineering the functions but the effort would be better spent on solving the task.',
