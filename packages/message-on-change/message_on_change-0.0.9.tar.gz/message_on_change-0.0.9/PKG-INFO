<h1>message on change</h1> is a small python program, that lets you check if a url has changed since the starting of the script.
This can be useful for
<ul>
    <li>
        waiting some results on some website
    </li>
    <li>
        Monitoring the update schedule of some sites
    </li>
</ul>

if you install the package regularly it will probably not be available as a shell command
on your system, and instead be installed in the ``~/.local/bin`` directory, from witch based on your shell
configuration you cannot launch the application.

Install with sudo to resolve:

```commandline
$ sudo pip install message-on-change
```
after the installation you should have two new commands available

```commandline
$ message-on-change
```
and
```commandline
$ message-on-change-cli
```

<h1>The gui version</h1>
The gui version is based on qt and is very easy to navigate and work with.
