## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/951417646191083551/1193927724616654909/image.png?ex=65ae7ed7&is=659c09d7&hm=5fd754a6776bb2998fd877218a1993f8aec01fa8de6a57cee7b3b4bb4e41858e&)

This language was made for making API's great ease and more efficiency. 

The language connects each API endpoint to a specific program/command, in case you want to write the code for the endpoint '/home' in python and '/generate' in Cpp - this can be done.

The language have packages for multiple languages for adapting april to the wanted language (some packages are made by the community too!!) . In case you dont find the required package for utilizing april in your wanted language - don't worry its easy to make a package for your own.

## Built With

- Written in python3
- Makes use of FASTAPI


## Features

- Easy install
- Simple
- Efficient
- Inbuild ratelimiting features (if req)
- Auto-Generated API Docs (if req)
- Banned IPs
- Disallow Private IPs (if req)
- Cross platform


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python3
- Pip3
- Redis server

### Installation

WIndows :
```sh
pip install aprillang
```

Linux / MacOs:
```sh
pip3 install aprillang
```

## Usage

Get the list of allowed commands
```sh
april -h
```

Get info of the language
```sh
april -a
```

Compile an .apl file (april file):
- This converts the april code to python3 code
- Compiled file is saved as filename without extention apl + '_apl.py'

```sh
april -c file.apl
```

Run an .apl file (start the API server):
- Format for the command is - april -r <filename> <host:port>

```sh
april -r file.apl 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Get the version of april:

```sh
april -v
```

# About making a package yourself
- The packages are used to connect the april program and the program dedicated to the endpoint.
- When the program pointed to the endpoint is called the program is suplied with a call ID in the form of commandline argument (last argument). The program can access details related to the request in the json file "." + call ID + ".input". And the output of the program can be put in to the json file "." + call ID + ".output".
## About the input and output files
### **Input File** : 
- Json file
- Filename : "." + call ID + ".input"
- Contains information about the request ,
  ```
  {
  "request" : dict containing info of the request,
  "input" : {"varible_name_in_the_url" : "value", ....}
  }
  ```
  - The 'request' dict have all the same keys as in [starlette.requests](https://www.starlette.io/requests/)

### **Output File** :
- Json file
- Filename : "." + call ID + ".output"
- Should contain information about the response ,
```
{
"headers" : <headers for the response>,
"status" : <status code>,
"output" : "the data to be send out to the user"
}
```
- The output and input files automatically gets deleted when the data in the output file is gained.
