# Snowflake Git

# Worksheet Versioning

Inspired by a snowflake developers maintained [repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfsnowsightextensions).

### Git integration 

The extension is designed to **apply git versioning on worksheets while developing on Snowsight, fully taking advantage of its functionalities**.\
The following workflow is advised :
1. [Start session] Upload worksheet from local branch to a user Snowsight workspace
2. Test, update and validate on Snowsight 
3. [End session] Update local branch with modified Snowsight worksheets

## Installation

Entry points are accessible through a CLI once the package is installed. 
To install it, please follow the following steps :

```bash
# [Optional: Python virtual environement]
$ pyenv virtualenv 3.10.4 sf
$ pyenv activate sf

# [Mandatory: Pip install]
$ pip install -U pip
$ pip install sf_git>=1.3

# [Check your installation]
$ sfgit --help

# [Should result in:]
# Usage: sfgit [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
# 
# Options:
#   --help  Show this message and exit.
# 
# Commands:
#   commit  Commit Snowsight worksheets to Git repository.
#   config  Configure sfgit for easier version control.
#   fetch   Fetch worksheets from user Snowsight account and store them in...
#   init    Initialize a git repository and set it as the sfgit versioning...
#   push    Upload locally stored worksheets to Snowsight user workspace.
```

Commands have been created to **import/export (respectively fetch/push) snowsight worksheets to/from local**.

## Git configuration

> **Warning**
> A git repository is necessary to manage worksheets. You can either use an existing one
> or create a new one.

To apply versioning to your worksheets, you need to **configure Git information**
through the config command. 

First, set git repository to be used:

```bash
# if you want to use an existing git repository
$ sfgit config --git-repo <path_to_git_repo>

# if you want to create a new one 
$ sfgit init -p <path_to_git_repo>
```

Then, set a location to save your worksheets within this git repository:
```bash
$ sfgit config --save-dir <path_to_worksheets_persistency_directory>
```

## Authentication
Currently, two authentication modes are supported i.e. credentials (PWD) and single sign-on (SSO).

Commands requiring Snowsight authentication all have options to provide at command time. 
If you don't want to manually input them everytime, you can set them at Python/Virtual environement level with :


```bash
$ sfgit config --account <your_snowsight_account_id>
$ sfgit config --username <your_snowsight_login_name>
$ sfgit config --password <your_snowsight_password>  # unnecessary for SSO authentication mode
```

## Usage

**Import user worksheet locally** :
```bash
$ sfgit fetch -username tdambrin -account-id my_account.west-europe.azure --auth-mode SSO
```

**Commit you worksheets** (or through git commands for more flexibility) :
```bash
$ sfgit commit --branch master -m "Initial worksheet commit"
```

**Export user worksheets to Snowsight** :
```bash
$ sfgit push --auth-mode SSO --branch master
```

## Policies
Feedbacks and contributions are greatly appreciated. This package was made to ease every day life for Snowflake 
developers and promote version control as much as possible.
