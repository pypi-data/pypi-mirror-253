# RAGxplorer 🦙🦺 

<img src="images/logo.png" width="200">

RAGxplorer is an interactive streamlit tool to support the building of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications by visualizing document chunks and the queries in the embedding space. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental re-factored version. 

## Demo 🔎
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://rag-xplorer.streamlit.app/)

⚠️ _Due to [infra limitations](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/is-there-streamlit-app-limitations-such-as-usage-time-users-etc/42800), this freely hosted demo may occasionally go down. The best experience is to clone this repo, and run it locally._

## Features ✨

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload PDF documents.
- **Chunk Configuration**: Options to configure the chunk size and overlap
- **Choice of embedding model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or `text-embedding-ada-002`
- **Vector Database Creation**: Builds a vector database using Chroma
- **Query Expansion**: Generates sub-questions and hypothetical answers to enhance the retrieval process.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Utilizes Plotly to visualise the chunks.

## Local Installation ⚙️

To run RAGxplorer, ensure you have Python installed, and then install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-local-deployment.txt
```

> [!TIP]
> ⚠️ Do not use `requirements.txt`. That is so the free streamlit deployment can run. That file includes an additional `pysqlite3-binary` dependency.
> 
> ⚠️ If it helps with troubleshooting, this application was built using Python 3.11

## Usage 🏎️

1. Setup `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required) and `ANYSCALE_API_KEY` (if you need anyscale). Copy
    the `.streamlit/secrets.example.toml` file to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and fill in the values.
2. To start the application, run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3. You may need to comment out/remove line 5-7 in `app.py`. 
    ```python
    __import__('pysqlite3')
    import sys
    sys.modules['sqlite3'] = sys.modules.pop('pysqlite3')
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> This repo is currently linked to the streamlit demo, and these lines were added due to the runtime in the free streamlit deployment env. See [here](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/issues-with-chroma-and-sqlite/47950).
