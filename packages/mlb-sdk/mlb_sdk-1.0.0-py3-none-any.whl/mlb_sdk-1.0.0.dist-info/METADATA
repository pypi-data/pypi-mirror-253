# MLB SDK

This library is intended to make it easier to use the MLB APIs (Stats API, DSP, etc). It does not provide access to the underlying APIs, you need to come with your own credentials provided by the league.

## Copyright Notice
This package and its author are not affiliated with MLB or any MLB team. This API wrapper interfaces with MLB's Stats API. Use of MLB data is subject to the notice posted at http://gdx.mlb.com/components/copyright.txt.
